# 3D Brain Reconstruction

This project implements a deep learning pipeline for longitudinal 3D brain MRI reconstruction using prior information and registration. 

The model combines sampling networks, registration networks, and reconstruction components to produce high-quality 3D brain images from undersampled data. 

Run `inference.py` or the Jupyter notebooks to perform reconstruction on your data, with support for visualization and metric evaluation including PSNR and SSIM.
